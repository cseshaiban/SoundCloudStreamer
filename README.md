# SoundCloudStreamer
Basic SoundCloud Streaming App Android

It is an extremely basic Soundcloud client for android. It supports listening to tracks and searching for tracks but that's it. Building this as an enhancement feature add on for my existing Music Player on the play store.

The default list shown contains the most recent tracks posted to soundcloud for now. 

Built with the Retrofit, gson, and picasso frameworks.
